# dictionary-app

A small application for storing English words with Russian translation


## About

This app is created by me for educational purposes only.
For me, it's a sort of pet project.
In the future I plan to develop it by adding various features and most likely going beyond the desktop application.


## Dictionary file

All words are stored in the `words.json` file.
It can be found at the path `documents/Dictionary/words.json`.
For the application to work properly, the file must have the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "en": "",
        "ru": ""
    },
    
    ...
    
    {
        "en": "",
        "ru": ""
    }
]
```
